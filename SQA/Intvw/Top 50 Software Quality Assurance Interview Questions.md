20. **What is a sprint in Agile?**
21. **How does QA fit into an Agile environment?**
22. **What is the difference between verification and validation in QA?**
	1. *Verification : product is build accordingly to the design, build product right*
	2. *Validation : meets users needs, build right product*
23. **What is a test environment, and why is it necessary?**
24. **What are the key qualities of a successful QA tester?**
25. **What is smoke testing, and when is it performed?**
	1. *Smoke testing is a preliminary test performed to check if the critical functionalities of an application are working as expected. It is usually conducted after a new build is released to verify its stability before deeper testing.*
26. **What is sanity testing, and how does it differ from smoke testing?**
	1. *Sanity testing is conducted to check specific functionalities after minor code changes or bug fixes. It is a more focused test than smoke testing and ensures that the recent changes did not break any other parts of the software.*
27. **What is risk-based testing?**
	1. *Risk-based testing involves prioritizing testing efforts based on the risk of failure in certain areas of the software. It focuses on testing the most critical areas where defects could have a significant impact on the user or business*
28. **How do you define entry and exit criteria in a test plan?**
	1. *Entry criteria define the conditions that must be met before testing can begin (e.g., environment setup, test cases ready). Exit criteria define the conditions that must be fulfilled before testing can be considered complete (e.g., all test cases executed, no high-priority defects open).*
29. **What is test data, and why is it important?**
30. **What is the difference between white-box testing and black-box testing?**
31. **What is user acceptance testing (UAT)?**
32. **What is regression testing, and why is it important?**
33. **What is end-to-end testing?**
34. **What is Continuous Integration (CI) in automation testing?**
	1. *Continuous Integration (CI) is a practice where developers frequently merge their code changes into a shared repository, followed by automated testing. It helps in early detection of issues and ensures that the software remains in a deployable state.*
35. **What is the Page Object Model (POM) in Selenium?**
	1. *Page Object Model (POM) is a design pattern in Selenium that creates object classes for web elements on a page. It improves test maintenance and reduces duplication of code by encapsulating the logic of UI interactions in separate classes.*
36. **What is the difference between Selenium WebDriver and Selenium IDE?**
	1. *Selenium IDE is a record-and-playback tool that allows users to create test scripts without programming, while Selenium WebDriver is a more advanced tool that requires writing code and supports multiple browsers and platforms.*
37. **What is cross-browser testing, and how do you implement it?**
	1.  *Cross-browser testing ensures that an application works as expected across different browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari). It can be implemented using automation tools like Selenium, which can execute tests across multiple browsers.*
38. **What is a defect severity and priority, and how are they different?**
39. **What are defect clustering and the Pareto principle in QA?**
	1. *Defect clustering refers to the phenomenon where a small number of modules in the software contain most of the defects. The Pareto principle (80/20 rule) states that 80% of defects are found in 20% of the code, and this concept is often used in QA to focus testing efforts.*
40. **What is root cause analysis in QA?**
41. **What is the role of a QA engineer in a Scrum team?**
	1.  *A QA engineer in a Scrum team collaborates with developers and product owners to define acceptance criteria, write and execute test cases, participate in daily scrums, and ensure that testing is conducted iteratively throughout the sprint.*
42. **How do you manage testing in continuous delivery (CD) pipelines?**
	1. *In CD pipelines, testing is automated and integrated into the build process. Automated tests (unit, integration, regression) are run continuously as part of the deployment pipeline to ensure that code is production-ready at any time.*
43. **What is Test-Driven Development (TDD) in Agile?**
	1. *TDD is a software development approach where test cases are written before the code is developed. Developers write a test for a specific functionality, then write the code to pass the test, and finally refactor the code to meet quality standards.*
44. **What is ISO 9001 in the context of software QA?**
	1. *ISO 9001 is a globally recognized quality management standard. In software QA, it refers to the implementation of quality management principles to ensure continuous improvement and consistent delivery of high-quality software*
45. **What is load testing, and how is it different from stress testing?**
	1. *Load testing measures the system’s performance under expected user loads to ensure it can handle peak usage. Stress testing pushes the system beyond its normal capacity to test its stability and identify its breaking point.*
46. **What is usability testing?**
	1. *Usability testing evaluates how easy it is for users to interact with the software. It measures the application’s user-friendliness, including how intuitive and efficient it is for users to complete tasks.*
47. **What are KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) in software testing?**
	1. *KPIs are metrics used to assess the effectiveness of the QA process. Common KPIs include test coverage, defect density, test execution time, and the number of defects found post-production.*
48. **What is Acceptance Test-Driven Development (ATDD)?**
	1. **ATDD is a practice where the acceptance criteria are defined in collaboration with stakeholders before the actual development begins. These criteria are then turned into automated tests to ensure the functionality meets stakeholder expectations.**
49. **What are common challenges faced in software testing?**
	1. *Ambiguous requirements*
	2. *Insufficient time for testing*
	3. *Changing requirements during testing*
	4. *Lack of proper test environments*
	5. *Difficulty in reproducing defects*
50. **What is shift-left testing, and why is it important?**
	1. *Shift-left testing refers to integrating testing earlier in the software development lifecycle, moving it “left” in the timeline. It helps identify and address defects early, reducing overall development costs and improving software quality.*
