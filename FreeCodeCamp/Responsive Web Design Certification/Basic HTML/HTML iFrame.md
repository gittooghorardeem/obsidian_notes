- `iframe` element. This element stands for inline frame. It's an inline element used to embed other HTML content directly within the HTML page. That HTML content could be a video, map, another HTML element, or even other web pages.
- The `src` attribute specifies the URL of the page you want to embed. The `width` attribute specifies the width of the `iframe`. The `height` attribute specifies the height of the `iframe`. The `allowfullscreen` attribute allows the user to display the `iframe` in full screen mode. It's also a good practice to specify a `title` attribute for the `iframe`, as it's important for accessibility.
  `<iframe`
  `width="400"`
  `height="400"`
  `src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfkjm2YRG-Q"`
  `title="The Hidden Science of Fireworks"`
  `allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"`
  `referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin"`
  `allowfullscreen`
  `></iframe>`
- The `allow` attribute, on the other hand, lets you define what an iframe can or can't do. This is called an allowlist. In the above example, adding `clipboard-write` to it allows the embedded page to write items to your clipboard. Items in an allowlist can be separated by semicolons or spaces, and both can be used together.
