- HTML -  Hyper Text Markup Language
- HTML represents the content and structure of a webpage
- While HTML defines the structure and content of a webpage, CSS is used to add style — things like colors, fonts, spacing, and layout.

- The `href` attribute specifies the URL of a link and the `target` attribute specifies where to open the link.
